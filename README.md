# SBIN_Data-Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the dataset of SBI stock and completed the assignemnt as a part of my Internship. 

1) We have SBI stock Open, high, low, close and volume data for every minute for every day
2) The data is from 1st Jan 2024 till 31st Jan 2024 ( Each day having 375 rows of data i.e. 9:15 am till 3:29 pm)
3) We have to rank the volume in a such a way that it checks the exact same time for every day and for the last 5 days, it gives us the rank of volume ( rank 1 means highest volume).
4) The output shall be stored in the current dataframe as  a new column "rank".
